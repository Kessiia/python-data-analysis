# Data Analysis with Python
Welcome to my data analysis repository! Here, you'll find a collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating my proficiency in data cleaning, wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and correlation analysis using Python.

## Overview
In this repository I am showcasing my proficiency in data analysis with Python, featuring projects, datasets, and analyses. Explore various projects, datasets, and analyses demonstrating my proficiency in handling and interpreting data. Each Jupyter Notebook showcases different techniques and methodologies to handle and interpret data, along with visualizations using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy and more. This specific repository will showcase the skills I've acquired directly through my Python data course, using their courses as a guideline. I will continue to update this repository with additional notebooks showcasing different aspects of data analysis, so be sure to check back regularly for new content!


## Key Features
- <B>Data Cleaning</B>: demonstrating various data cleaning techniques, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
- <B>Data Wranling</B>: manipulating and transforming data focusing on data aggregation, merging, reshaping, and more.
- <B>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</B>: utilizing descriptive statistics, visualizations, and summary tables to gain insights and understand the underlying patterns in the data.
- <B>Correlation Analysis</B>: investigating relationships between variables and identify correlations using correlation matrices, scatter plots, and correlation coefficients.
