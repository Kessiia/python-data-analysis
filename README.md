# Data Analysis with Python
Welcome to my data analysis repository! Here, you'll find a collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating my proficiency in data cleaning, wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and correlation analysis using Python.

## Overview
In this repository I am showcasing my proficiency in data analysis with Python, featuring projects, datasets, and analyses. Explore various projects, datasets, and analyses demonstrating my proficiency in handling and interpreting data. Each Jupyter Notebook showcases different techniques and methodologies to handle and interpret data, along with visualizations using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy and more. This specific repository will showcase the skills I've acquired directly through my Python data course, using their courses as a guideline. I will continue to update this repository with additional notebooks showcasing different aspects of data analysis, so be sure to check back regularly for new content!


## Key Features
- <B>Data Cleaning</B>: demonstrating various data cleaning techniques, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
- <B>Data Wranling</B>: manipulating and transforming data focusing on data aggregation, merging, reshaping, and more.
- <B>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</B>: utilizing descriptive statistics, visualizations, and summary tables to gain insights and understand the underlying patterns in the data.
- <B>Correlation Analysis</B>: investigating relationships between variables and identify correlations using correlation matrices, scatter plots, and correlation coefficients.

## Navigate Through the Project
There are two data sets we are working with, provided by the course I was following. One on car pricing and one on laptop pricing info. Each notebook has a detailed explenation of the datasets. At the start of each notebook the course gives a short introduction and guidance, where at the second half of the notebook I have to write my own code to solve problems and answer questions provided by the course.
- [Importing Data & Data Cleaning](https://github.com/Kessiia/python-data-analysis/blob/698f445277540891d97e3b6f647427f47a4fe0e1/Data_loading_laptop_pricing.jupyterlite.ipynb): I focus on data cleaning and importing, guided by concepts learned in the module. I show my ability to manipulate and prepare data by crafting custom code while still drawing on the guidance provided by the course.
- [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/Kessiia/python-data-analysis/blob/698f445277540891d97e3b6f647427f47a4fe0e1/Data_wrangling_laptop_prices.jupyterlite.ipynb): here I focus on data wrangling, applying techniques learned in the module to manipulate and transform the data.
- [Exploritory Data Analysis](https://github.com/Kessiia/python-data-analysis/blob/698f445277540891d97e3b6f647427f47a4fe0e1/Exploratory_data_analysis_laptop_pricing.jupyterlite.ipynb): I dive into Exploratory Data Analysis using a dataset on laptop pricing, showcasing skills learned from the module by crafting custom code based on course concepts, with the course still providing some guidance.
- [Predictive Model Development using SLR, MLR and Polynomial Regression](https://github.com/Kessiia/python-data-analysis/blob/65ca5fdedd0a376cdbe0a5134fe7856f04a2911e/Model_development_laptops.jupyterlite.ipynb): I independently explore the predictive power of different regression models—Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and Polynomial Regression—using the dataset on latpop pricing. With minimal to no guidance from the course, I demonstrate my ability to build and evaluate these models for predictive analysis, demonstrating my proficiency in regression techniques.
